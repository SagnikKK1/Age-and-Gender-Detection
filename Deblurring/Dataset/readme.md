# About the Dataset
Blurred images from GoPro cameras, often due to motion blur, present challenges for image clarity, especially in fast-paced scenes. To address this, we employ MPRNet for deblurring. MPRNet, a deep learning-based approach, enhances image sharpness by analyzing blur kernels and motion parameters. This method is crucial for age identification tasks, ensuring clearer and more accurate image data for analysis. As GoPro cameras continue to evolve, effective deblurring techniques like MPRNet play a vital role in enhancing image quality for various applications, including age identification in dynamic environments.
